You define models → Prisma generates SQL → Postgres executes it.

---------------------
How to write Prisma code?

schema.prisma is NOT SQL
It is NOT TypeScript

It’s a schema definition language (DSL) that describes:

Tables → model

Columns → fields

Relations → @relation

Constraints → @id, @unique

Indexes → @@index

Prisma converts this into real SQL for Postgres.

-------------------

Rules:
Rule 1 — Model = Table
model Customer {
}

Rule 2 — Field syntax
fieldName Type Modifiers


Example:

email String @unique


Prisma Type / Postgres Meaning
String => TEXT / VARCHAR
Int	=> INTEGER
Boolean	=> BOOLEAN
DateTime => TIMESTAMP
Decimal	=> DECIMAL

Node = JavaScript runtime outside the browser
Why Node exists

Browsers already had:

JS engine (V8)

Event loop

Async I/O

But:

No filesystem access

No sockets

No DB access

Node took V8 and added system APIs:

Files (fs)

Network (http, net)

Processes

Environment variables

So now JS can:

Listen on ports

Talk to databases

Read/write files

That’s why backend JS is possible.

Express — why it exists

Express is a thin abstraction over Node’s HTTP module

It gives you:

Routing

Middleware pipeline

Request/response helpers

Predictable structure

It just organizes HTTP logic.

Think of Express as:

“A traffic controller for requests”

Express mental model:
Every request goes through:
Request
  ↓
Middleware 1
  ↓
Middleware 2
  ↓
Route handler
  ↓
Response

- Middleware can:

Modify request

Block request

Attach data

Log

Authenticate

| Layer      | Responsibility  |
| ---------- | --------------- |
| Node       | Runtime         |
| Express    | HTTP + routing  |
| Prisma     | Data access     |
| PostgreSQL | Source of truth |
